# HM-CI-with-Jackknife-Bootstrap
We explore the use of jackknife and bootstrap method as discussed in "Using resampling techniques to compute confidence intervals for the harmonic mean of rate-based performance metrics" [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5394469/?casa_token=qpyuFudV8W4AAAAA:M9qfunBLB-BcTaydzKOfdPSdGAmXG3sTcOtIPsdbTtc8178XkcIKjSOjz94qBSJ11WJY11KnsZM].

Jackknife and Bootstrap  statistical resampling method is a way to determine the confidence interval for the harmonic mean of rate-based metrics like FLOPs, IPC and so on. 
The ideal way to calculate the Confidence Interval for the Arithmetic mean doesn't yield right answer for the Harmonic mean due to differences in the mathematical derivation. The paper mentioned above discuss the use of non-parametric method for resampling to calculate the Confidence Interval (C.I.) of Harmonic Mean.
